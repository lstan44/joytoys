JoyToys is an online web application created to connect underprivileged children with generous anonymous donors. Parents can register on JoyToys and link their Amazon wishlist. 

Anonymous donors are presented with a randomly selected with a recipients wishlist. No PII (personally identifiable information) is shared between either parties during this process!
